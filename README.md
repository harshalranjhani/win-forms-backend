This project is an Express server written in TypeScript with endpoints for handling form submissions and retrieving them from a JSON file. It is designed to be deployed on Vercel as well as to run locally.

## Getting Started

- npm (version 6 or higher)

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

Differences between Local and Vercel Routes
Local Routes: When running locally, the base URL is http://localhost:8080. All routes should be accessed using this base URL. For example, http://localhost:8080/ping.

Vercel Routes: When deployed on Vercel, the base URL will be your Vercel project's domain, such as https://winforms.harshalranjhani.in. All routes should be accessed using this base URL. For example, https://winforms.harshalranjhani.in/ping.
